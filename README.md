# Web portfolio development and hosting repo

This project was made with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) for styling.

## Motive
I started making this website during a hackathon. I used React and Materia UI and deployed it with gh pages. I learnt a lot about designing, maintaining and deploying websites. I plan on making version 2 with Gatsby for better load times and SEO.

## Deployment

The website is deployed at www.gtang.ca
